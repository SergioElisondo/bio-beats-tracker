Conversely, when the intellectual cycle is in a negative range, we may experience more difficulty with cognitive tasks and may be more prone to errors or mental fatigue.\n              <br /><br />\n              To interpret biorhythms readings for the intellectual cycle, you would typically plot the cycle on a graph with the y-axis representing the percentage of the cycle completed and the x-axis representing time. As with the physical and emotional cycles, the midpoint of the cycle (day 16.5) is marked as the \"zero\" point, with positive values to the right and negative values to the left.\n              <br /><br />\n              To determine whether the intellectual cycle is in a positive or negative range, you would look at the current value on the graph and compare it to the zero point. If the value is to the right of the zero point, the intellectual cycle is in a positive range, and if it is to the left, the intellectual cycle is in a negative range.\n              <br /><br />\n              As with the physical and emotional cycles, it's important to note that biorhythms theory is considered by many to be pseudoscientific, and there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that our mental abilities follow a predictable pattern over time. Therefore, it's generally not recommended to base important decisions or actions on biorhythms readings.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"dropdown-container last-container\">\n          <IonButton className=\"info-button button-style\" onClick={toggleInfo6}>How To Read Results</IonButton>\n          <div className={`dropdown-menu ${ active === '6' ?

This is seen as a time of high energy, positivity, and mental clarity, and we may be more likely to achieve our goals and succeed in our endeavors.\n              <br /><br />\n              Conversely, when all three cycles are in a negative range, it is believed that we may be more pronse to physical fatigue, negative emotions, and mental fatigue. This is seen as a time of decreased energy, motivation, and productivity, and we may be more likely to make mistakes or experience setbacks.\n              <br /><br />\n              When the cycles are in mixed ranges, the interpretation can be more nuanced. For example, if the physical cycle is in a negative range but the emotional and intellectual cycles are in a positive range, it may be a time when we are feeling emotionally and mentally sharp but physically tired. Alternatively, if the emotional cycle is in a negative range but the physical and intellectual cycles are in a positive range, we may be physically and mentally capable but struggling with negative emotions.\n              <br /><br />\n              It's important to note that biorhythms theory is considered by many to be pseudoscientific, and there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that our states follow predictable patterns over time. Therefore, it's generally not recommended to rely on biorhythms readings for making important decisions or taking action. However, some people find tracking their biorhythms to be a fun and interesting way to gain insight into their overall well-being.</p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <div
